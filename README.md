# Password-Manager

This is a password manager that I made as part of my club's workshop for another cybersecurity club. I wanted to showcase our club's focus on being creative and building programs as well as make something that interests the cybersecurity enthusiasts.

This is a very beginner level manager so feel free to use it as base and keep experimenting with it!
